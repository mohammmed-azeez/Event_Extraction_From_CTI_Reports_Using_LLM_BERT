# Event-Extraction-from-Cyber-Threat-Report-Using-BERT-Model

The original dataset is from [Ebiquity/CASIE](https://github.com/Ebiquity/CASIE),
We have meticulously relabeled all the data and converted it to a sentence-level task. This new dataset is also being utilized for other cybersecurity classification tasks.

Our research has been submitted to the Cryptology and Information Security Conference 2024. We will update this README file once we receive confirmation of acceptance from the conference.

Thank you for your interest in our work.
